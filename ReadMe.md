## Overview
This project is a password generator webpage that allows users to create strong, random passwords and encrypt them using various encryption algorithms. The webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

* Generate random passwords with customizable length.  
* Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in the password.  
* Encrypt passwords using one of the following algorithms:  

    * AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)  
    * DES (Data Encryption Standard)  
    * ROT13 (Rotate by 13 places)  
    * Caesar Cipher  


## Technologies Used

* HTML: For structuring the webpage.  
* CSS: For styling the webpage.  
* JavaScript: For implementing the password generation and encryption functionalities.  


## How to Use

* **Open** the Webpage: Open the index.html file in your web browser.  
* Set Password Length: Use the slider to set the desired length of the password.  
* Generate Password: Click the “Generate Password” button to create a random password.  
* Select Encryption Algorithm: Choose an encryption algorithm from the dropdown menu.  
* Encrypt Password: Click the “Encrypt Password” button to encrypt the generated password.  
* View Encrypted Password: The encrypted password will be displayed in the designated field.  


## Encryption Algorithms  

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
    AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe. It provides a high level of security and is used in various applications.  

### DES (Data Encryption Standard)
    DES is an older symmetric encryption algorithm that was widely used in the past. It has been largely replaced by AES due to its shorter key length and lower security.  

### ROT13 (Rotate by 13 places)
    ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter with the letter 13 places after it in the alphabet. It is not suitable for serious encryption but is often used for obfuscating text.  

### Caesar Cipher
    The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. It is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
